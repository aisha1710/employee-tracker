## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).

Employee tracker is used to create and manage employee databases for businesses. Employee Tracker can scale appropriately with a company's development without changing the fundamental structure of the internal employee data base because it is built on MySQL and makes use of modularity in its design. This application can serve as a base upon which further development might be made. Employee tracker makes it possible for managers or other corporate members to observe all personnel, jobs, and departments. Additionally, it enables updating of employees from your CLI as well as addition of employees, roles, and departments.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run command `npm install`. To view database from MySQL run `mysql -u root -p`.

## Usage

Run `npm start` command on terminal. Input contents when prompted.
